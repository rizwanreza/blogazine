Blogazine is a blog publishing system with a twist. It's been build from the ground up to make a weblog for custom-designed posts. Every post has a separate stylesheet to it. Don't use it as a regular blog posting platform unless you're ready for a headache! 

== Getting Started

1. Clone the project
2. Install required gems by running rake gems:install.
3. Setup databases in config/database.yml and run rake db:create.
4. Migrate the databases by running rake db:migrate.
5. Load up admin by rake db:seed.
6. Fire up the server.
7. Start publishing.

== Under Development

This is currently under heavy development. It is not recommended to use this in production until I say so here. Thanks!
